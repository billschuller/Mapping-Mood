Mapping Mood
==========================

This D3 visualization focuses on exposing location patterns in data. It exposes the geotagged (lat/long) data along with a data value and associated tags. 

A live version is available [here](http://quantifiedself.com/visproject/mood_location.html). 

Example Data
------------

The example data included here was generated by a long-term mood tracking practice. Mood scores were tracked using the [Expereal App](http://www.expereal.com). Expereal offers a csv export function in the app. The data in this example was donated by [Bill Schuller](http://www.dataobsessive.com).

Attributions

This visualization was developed with help from Brandon Liu [web](http://bdon.org)/[github](http://www.github.com/bdon).
